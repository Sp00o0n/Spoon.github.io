            <h1>Hi, I’m Cecil.</h1>

            <p>
              I’m a nuclear engineering student and researcher interested in instrumentation,
              radiation detection, and building tools that make lab work easier.
            </p>

            <p>
              This site is where I keep a lot of projects, research notes, and whatever else I’m working on
              (plus a little goofiness so it doesn’t feel like a corporate brochure).
              Keep in mind this isn't intended to be professional nor is it intended to be used in any serious matter.
            </p>

    <!-- BOOK TEMPLATE -->
    <div class="book-item">
      <div class="book-title">Divine Comedy</div>
      <div class="book-author">Dante Alighieri</div>
      <div class="book-note">There is a lot to take from this book, as its not only massive, but also packed full of moral concepts to divulge. The two that I've come to notice the most is that: Love can lead to harmony, but also to ones ruin. Pain that leads to growth is fundamentally different from pain that leads to stagnation.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="book-item">
      <div class="book-title">Dante's Inferno</div>
      <div class="book-author">Dante Alighieri</div>
      <div class="book-note">This book shows what happens when love collapses into fixation, when pain loses its power to teach, and when pain replaces love as a purpose to live. Hell has layers, but through it all no one there is asking for forgiveness. One's sin can be born of love, but it'll always be a twisted form. Forced into a justification used to damn yourself to its misunderstanding. </div>
    </div>

    <div class="book-item">
      <div class="book-title">Crime and Punishment</div>
      <div class="book-author">Fyodor Dostoevsky</div>
      <div class="book-note">Along with most books in this list, it helped model my morals as a person. There is something to be said about the intersection of utilitarian thoughts such as with the grandma, and basic social norms that make this a pretty dirty way to shock one's beliefs.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="book-item">
      <div class="book-title">Paradise Lost</div>
      <div class="book-author">John Milton</div>
      <div class="book-note">While this one (being a book also about religion) seems similar to the other religous books here, its honestly the most different. This ends up being an interrogation of freedom. It really makes you think about when obediance and freedom conflict, but the most direct thing you'll learn is that pain isn't an isolated effort. Sometimes its raught from ignorance, from choice, from justification, and from love. </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="book-item">
      <div class="book-title">The Stranger</div>
      <div class="book-author"> Albert Camus</div>
      <div class="book-note">I had to add this one, if not only because its what turned me completely away from the idea of Nihilism. Not that I was ever interested in it in the first place.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="book-item">
      <div class="book-title">Solaris</div>
      <div class="book-author">Stanisław Lem</div>
      <div class="book-note">Probably one of the best Polish books I've read. This was my first and my favorite as I learned the language.</div>
